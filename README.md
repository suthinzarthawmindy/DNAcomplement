# DNAcomplement



A DNA string is made up of four symbols: A,T, C and G. Each has a complement in which A and T complement each other and C and G complement each other. 
Determine the reverse complement of a DNA string by reversing symbols in the string and replacing each symbol in the reversed string by its complement.
